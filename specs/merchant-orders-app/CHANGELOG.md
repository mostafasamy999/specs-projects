## CR-001 — 2026-10-20 — Negative stock (order when stock is 0)

**Request:** Offered products must stay orderable when stock is 0. If stock is 0 and 5 units are ordered, stock becomes −5. Customers can see stock.

**Decision:**
- `isActive` (offered) is the only gate for ordering; stock never blocks an order.
- Stock may go negative; `shortage = max(0, −stock)` shown on admin list and dashboard (sortable "what to buy" list).
- New admin action "receive stock" (`stock += qty`) + manual stock correction.
- Customers see positive stock only ("متوفر: n"); at ≤ 0 they see "متاح بالطلب".
- Max 99 units per product per order (selector no longer limited by stock).
- Checkout fails only if a product was hidden/removed → `ProductUnavailableException`.
- Concurrent orders on the same product all succeed; counters stay exact.

**Affected:**
- Requirements: Glossary (offered, stock, shortage), R6.1, R6.5, R6.8 *(new)*, R6.9 *(new)*, R7.1, R7.2, R8.2–8.5, R9.4, R9.5, R13.4, Assumptions 6–7 *(new)*
- Design: D§3.2, D§3.4, D§4.3, D§4.7, D§5 (`validOrderDelta`, product create rule), D§6, D§8, D§9
- Tasks: T2.4, T2.5, T2.7 *(new)*, T3.1, T3.4, T3.5, T5.1, T7.4

**Rejected / out of scope:** Handling a discontinued product with pending negative stock — explicitly ignored for MVP.
